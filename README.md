## 🏛️ Overview

The YesuWay Church SMS Broadcasting System is a production-ready communication platform that allows any congregation member to send a message to one number, which then broadcasts that message to the entire church community across multiple groups. This creates a unified conversation where everyone stays connected, regardless of which original group they belonged to.

### ✨ Key Benefits

- **📱 Universal Access**: Works with any phone (iPhone, Android, flip phones)
- **📸 Rich Media Support**: Share photos, audio, and videos with the entire congregation
- **👑 Admin Controls**: Church leaders can manage members and view statistics via SMS
- **🤖 Auto-Management**: New members are automatically added when they text
- **☁️ 24/7 Operation**: Cloud-hosted for reliable, always-on service
- **🛡️ Error-Free**: Advanced media processing eliminates delivery failures
